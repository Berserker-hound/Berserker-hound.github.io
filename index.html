        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong>Remove the steak from the refrigerator a half hour before cooking.

Cut away any tough connective tissue on the surface of the steak.

Using the tip of a sharp knife, poke small cuts into the meat, almost all the way through. The cuts should be at an angle, in the direction of the grain of the meat as the knife tip is going in. The cuts should be about an inch apart from each other.

Turn the steak over and repeat the cuts on the other side. Make sure that the cuts you are making on this side are parallel with the cuts you made on the other side, otherwise you may cut across an existing cut, and end up poking a hole through the meat.<br>
            <strong>Step 2:</strong>Sprinkle one side of the steak with salt and freshly ground pepper. Sprinkle the steak with dry mustard. (You can use regular mustard if you don't have any dry mustard.)

Rub a tablespoon of butter all over the side of the steak. Turn the steak over and repeat with the dry mustard, pepper, and butter.<br>
            <strong>Step 3:</strong> Heat a large cast iron frying pan on high heat. Place steak in hot pan. Let sear for 2 to 3 minutes until well browned.

Use tongs to lift up to see if nicely browned. If so, flip to the other side and let sear for 2 to 3 minutes.<br>
            <strong>Step 4:</strong>Remove the pan from the heat and let the steak continue to cook for 5 to 10 minutes in the residual heat of the pan (assuming you are using cast iron, if not, lower the heat to low).<br>
            
            <strong>Step 5:</strong> Use your fingertips to check for doneness or insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the steak - 120°F for very rare, 125°F for rare, or 130°F for medium rare. Flank steak should be served rare or medium rare, otherwise it may be too dry.<br>
            <strong>Step 6:</strong>Remove the steak from the pan to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes, covered with aluminum foil.<br>
            <strong>Step 7:</strong>Cut the meat in very thin slices, at an angle, across the grain of the meat. (This way you break through the tough long muscle fibers.)<br>
            <strong>Step 8:</strong>Any juices that come out of the meat while cutting or resting, return to the pan. Return the pan to a burner on high heat and deglaze the pan with a little water, scraping up any browned bits. Once the water has mostly boiled down, add a little butter to the pan for a nice sauce.

Arrange the cut meat on a serving plate and pour the deglazed pan juices over the meat.<br>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong>Soak the dried porcini mushrooms in 2 cups hot water. .<br>
            <strong>Step 2:</strong>Cut the rabbit into serving pieces and salt well. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Use all of the rabbit in this dish – you can fish out the ribs and other parts that have little or no meat on them later; they will add vital flavor to your stew.<br>
            <strong>Step 3:</strong> Preheat the oven to 375°F. Slice the top third off the heads of garlic and drizzle the olive oil over them. Wrap the heads loosely in foil and bake for 45 minutes to an hour, or until cloves are soft and brown. Set aside to cool.<br>
            <strong>Step 4:</strong>Chop off the tough ends of the mushroom stems and either discard or save for stock. Roughly chop or slice the mushrooms and set aside. Dice the rehydrated porcini. Pour the porcini soaking water though a paper towel into another bowl. Reserve the liquid.<br>
            <strong>Step 5:</strong>Heat a thick-bottomed large pot on high heat for 1 minute. Add the mushrooms and shake the pot. Stirring continuously, dry sauté the mushrooms until they release their water.Turn the heat down to medium-high. Use a wooden spoon to scrape up any mushroom bits off the bottom of the pan. Salt the mushrooms lightly. When the mushroom liquid is mostly gone, remove them to a bowl.<br>
            <strong>Step 6:</strong>Add the butter to the pot. When the butter melts, turn the heat down to medium. Pat the rabbit pieces dry and place in the pan.Work in batches if you need to, do not crowd the pan. Brown the pieces well on all sides. Remove the rabbit pieces from the pot and set aside.<br>
            <strong>Step 7:</strong>Increase the the heat to medium-high and add the shallots to the pot. Sauté until the shallots are nicely wilted, about 3 minutes. Stir from time to time. Sprinkle salt over everything.<br>
            <strong>Step 8:</strong>While the shallots are cooking, squeeze the roasted garlic into the mushroom soaking water you have strained, then whisk it together.<br>
            <strong>Step 9:</strong> Add the sherry or white wine to the shallots in the pot. Use a wooden spoon to scrape off any browned bits on the bottom of the pot. Let the sherry boil down by half. Add the mushroom-roasted garlic mixture and the stock and stir to combine.<br>
            <strong>Step 10:</strong>Add the thyme, all the     mushrooms, the rabbit and the parsnips and bring everything to a bare simmer.<br>
            <strong>Step 11:</strong> If you are using the crème fraiche-liver mixture to thicken your stew, turn off the heat. When the stew stops bubbling, add the mixture and let it heat through for a minute before serving.

Serve with a crusty loaf of bread, a green salad and either a hearty white wine, a dry rose or a light red wine.<br>
